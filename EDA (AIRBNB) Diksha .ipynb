The dataset contains over 49,000 listings with various features including location, price, room type, availability, number of reviews, and more.\n","\n","The analysis aimed to uncover patterns in listing performance, pricing behavior, geographical trends, and supply distribution across New York City. The ultimate goal was to identify strategies to enhance user satisfaction, improve host efficiency, balance market supply and demand, and drive positive business outcomes for the platform.\n","\n","The dataset was first cleaned by handling missing values (notably in the `reviews_per_month` column), removing outliers in key features such as `price` and `minimum_nights`, and filtering out invalid or extreme geographic coordinates. The dataset was then explored through 15 visualizations, each designed to highlight a specific business aspect.\n","\n","Key findings include that **room type**, **location**, and **availability** are the most significant factors influencing listing success. Listings with **shorter minimum night requirements** (1â€“3 days) and **high annual availability** are more likely to receive frequent bookings. **Private rooms** are consistently available and affordable, making them appealing to solo travelers and budget-conscious guests. Meanwhile, **entire home/apartment** listings are priced higher and often concentrated in premium areas like Manhattan.\n","\n","A detailed breakdown of borough-level insights showed that **Manhattan and Brooklyn** dominate the listing volume, but this saturation may lead to regulatory challenges and internal competition. Conversely, **Staten Island, the Bronx, and parts of Queens** are underserved markets with growth potential. Targeted host acquisition strategies in these areas could help Airbnb balance its supply geographically.\n","\n","From a pricing perspective, we observed that `price` does not strongly correlate with individual numerical features like `minimum_nights` or `availability_365`. Instead, it is more closely influenced by room type and location, suggesting that dynamic, context-aware pricing models would be more effective than flat-rate strategies. Additionally, properties with high availability but low review activity may need platform support to improve visibility or quality.\n","\n","The use of geospatial scatter plots and heatmaps provided insight into how listings are distributed across NYC, with clusters of dense activity in central areas. Pair plots and correlation matrices helped validate assumptions and explore inter-feature relationships.\n","\n","Based on these findings, a number of business recommendations were proposed, including optimizing pricing strategies using machine learning, encouraging hosts to reduce minimum stay requirements, promoting room-type diversity in concentrated markets, and onboarding hosts in underserved areas. These actions are expected to improve booking rates, guest satisfaction, host success, and overall platform performance.\n","\n","\n","In conclusion, this EDA project provided a data-driven foundation for strategic decision-making in the Airbnb ecosystem. By leveraging the insights uncovered through this analysis, Airbnb and its stakeholders can improve platform efficiency, enhance user experience, and sustainably grow their market presence in New York City.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Airbnb faces challenges in understanding what drives listing success in a competitive market like New York City.
